# Cave-monitoring.org
host the template file for www.cave-monitoring.org

As agreed on the 2nd International Workshop of Cave Monitoring in Innsbruck, Austria, we set up a web-based database as a platform to improve and coordinate research activities in the fields of cave meteorology, karst and speleothem science and subterranean ecology. 

The template (Cave_Monitoring_Information_Survey.xls) can be be downloaded on www.cave-monitoring.org and from www.github.com/SimonMischel/Cave-monitoring.org repository...
